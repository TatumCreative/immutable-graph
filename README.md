# Immutable Graph

These are my initial thoughts on creating and working with immutable graph structure with history.

### Intended use case:

http://node.graphics/

### To run:

The example requires the following global npm modules:

    npm install browserify -g
    npm install beefy -g    

To run the example in your browser:

    beefy nav-example.js
    beefy history-example.js

Tests can be run by:

    npm test
