# Immutable Graph

These are my initial thoughts on creating and working with an immutable graph structure with history.

### Intended use case:

http://node.graphics/

### To run:

The example requires the following global npm modules:

To run the example in your browser:

    beefy examples/history-example.js
    beefy examples/move-example.js
    beefy examples/traverse-example.js

Or if beefy is not globally installed:

    node_modules/.bin/beefy examples/history-example.js
    node_modules/.bin/beefy examples/move-example.js
    node_modules/.bin/beefy examples/traverse-example.js

Tests can be run by:

    npm test
